#' healthcare administrators to project revenue with monthly adjustments
#' and procedure-specific boosts up to a 3-year period. Granular data
#' (patient-level) to aggregated data (department- or hospital-level) can
#' all be used as valid inputs provided historical volume and revenue
#' data is available.
