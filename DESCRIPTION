Description: Provides a shiny interface for a free, open-source managerial
    accounting-like system for health care practices. This package allows
    health care administrators to project revenue with monthly adjustments
    and procedure-specific boosts up to a 3-year period. Granular data
    (patient-level) to aggregated data (department- or hospital-level) can
    all be used as valid inputs provided historical volume and revenue
    data is available. For more details on managerial accounting
    techniques, see Brewer et al. (2015, ISBN:9780078025792).
